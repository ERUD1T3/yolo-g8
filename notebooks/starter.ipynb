    "### Dataset Prep and Preprocessing (20 points)\n",
    "- Collect or create a dataset of images containing the objects you want to detect annotated with bounding boxes.\n",
    "- Implement data preprocessing techniques, including:\n",
    "  - Resizing images\n",
    "  - Normalizing pixels\n",
    "- Hint: You can find pre-annotated datasets for download on [Roboflow](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture (30 points)\n",
    "- Train a YOLOv8 model on your selected dataset using the public repository available at [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).\n",
    "- Monitor the training progress and use appropriate techniques to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- Conduct at least 3 tuning experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation (20 points)\n",
    "- Evaluate your trained model's performance on a test dataset using mAP (mean Average Precision).\n",
    "- Visualize the model's predictions on sample images.\n",
    "- Analyze the model's performance, discussing any specific failure modes on your test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BONUS (25 bonus points)\n",
    "- Design and train a custom CNN-based object detection model using a self-designed architecture.\n",
    "- Alternatively, compare several publicly available models on the same dataset.\n",
    "- Consider implementing Gaussian YOLO V8 and comparing it against YOLO V8.\n",
